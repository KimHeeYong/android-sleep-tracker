% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  %\graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
Snoring is not only health problem for snorers but also great thread for partner’s life. In this project, we suggest a method by analyzing real-time audio data from a smart phone’s microphone which could successfully identify the snoring sound and take actions such as vibration, alarm etc. to notify the snorer to adjust himself/herself. Two features from sound data which are energy and zero-crossing rate applied to detect snoring.  By experimenting with sound data from freesound.org, we’re able to set thresholds for figuring out regular snoring patterns.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
Normal people spend one third of their life in sleep, and it is estimated that approximately 30\% to 50\% of the US population snore at one time or another, some significantly. Snoring causes a few problems including marital discord, sleep disturbances and waking episodes which is caused by one's own snoring\cite{aaoms:2013}. In some serious condition, apnea which is a potentially life-threatening disease developed from simple snoring. Thus, we're looking for a method to use cell phones to do real-time analysis at night and give proper responses to the snorer in order to alert the person. In this way, we could train the user to stop snoring.  \\

In this paper, an android app is built for this purpose. The app contains three main components which are sound capturing module, analysis module and action module. In sound capturing module, we used raw data from microphone input. After microphone collected large enough data, they were sent analysis module. The analysis module extracted two key features which are energy and zero crossing rate in order to identify the snoring. After snoring sound was confirmed, action module responded with pre-recorded alarm.

\subsection{Snoring Detection Methods} % (fold)
\label{sub:snoring_detection_methods}

	Numerous researchers are interested in snoring signal features and detection. Back in 1996, Fiz tried to figure out the difference in snoring sound among simple snoring patients and obstructive sleep apnea patients\cite{fiz1996acoustic}. Their research demonstrated significant difference in sound power spectrum of snoring sound between subjects with simple snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea which means that it should be possible to identify different snoring patterns. In 2006, Duckitt\cite{duckitt2006automatic} suggested using Hidden Markov Models(HMMs) as basic elements to model different type of sound. In \cite{duckitt2006automatic}, the authors made overnight audio recordings for six subjects, and analyze the data afterwards. This approach is not perfect since feedback can not be provided when the subject is snoring. Cheng\cite{cheng2008development} implemented a portable device to detect sleep apnea syndrome. The device is made up of recorder, LCD screen, microphone etc. which all can be found in a normal cell phone. \cite{ccavucsouglu2007efficient} also introduced a method to detect snoring by time and frequency analysis. The method is used in our project, but adjustments need to be made since snoring sound is normally in low frequency area\cite{pevernagie2010acoustics}\cite{calabrese2011system}. Thus, we'd analyze frequency lower than 500 HZ instead of 0-7500 HZ range.

\subsection{Awakening Methods} % (fold)
\label{sub:awakening_methods}

What is the proper way to wake a person up? Thomas's research shows that voice alarm was quite effective for younger age groups but not for older adults\cite{thomas2010awakening}.The paper\cite{thomas2010awakening} also mentioned the mother's message including the child's name several times is quite effective when waking the kid's up. It lays the foundation for us to use human voice, especial a snorer's name as alarm. In Bruck's experiment, it shows male's voice is more effective than a female's voice\cite{bruck2008comparison}. For short arousal while sleeping, people will have short term memory lost, so it is hard to people to notice how many times they woke up\cite{bonnet1983memory}. This helps us to let the app alert with certain duration.

\caption{Overview of the App}
\label{fig:app_overview}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:app_modules} demonstrates the overall structure. In order to do real-time analysis and give correspond alarm actions, the project uses a pipeline structure which contains \emph{Sound Capture}, \emph{Sound Analysis} and \emph{Action Module}. In \emph{Sound Analysis} step, the sound raw data has to be sliced and processed first, then by calculating the energy and zero-crossing rate to classify the sound type which is a binary decision. The pre-recorded alarm in \emph{Action Module} is activated once the system confirms the user is snoring. The decision of alarm is made by the count of detected snoring \(m\). \\

This system is multi-threaded and consists of five main threads. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:app_overview}, the five threads are Main thread, Recording thread, Display thread, Analysis thread and Alarm thread.\\
\begin{description}
  \item[Main thread] \hfill \\
  Main thread is in charge of main Graph User Interface display and invoking other threads including Recording, Analysis and Display thread. In other word, this is the parent thread of the whole system. Since in Android system, children threads are not able to modify user interface, so we create many handlers in main thread in order to control functions like message display and alarm output.
  \item[Recording thread] \hfill \\
  Called by main thread. Recording thread keeps recording the sound while user is sleeping. This is a child thread that running all the time. We use Android system method AudioRecord to implement the recording function.
  \item[Display thread] \hfill \\
  Called by Recording thread. Display thread keep drawing and refreshing the oscilloscope stimulation function which recording thread is running.
  \item[Analysis thread] \hfill \\
  Called by main thread. Analysis thread calls the sound analysis function to judge if the input sound is snoring or not.
  \item[Alarm thread] \hfill \\
  Called by analysis thread. Alarm thread output the alarm sound when snoring being detected.

\section{Results} % (fold)
\label{sec:results}
The app supports Android 2.3.3(API Level 10) or later. It is tested in Samsung Galaxy s3.\\

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:app_screenshot}.The user needs to record his voice as an alarm first. User's name is recommended to record as the alarming message. After tapping on start, the app enters into detection mode. If snoring is detected $ m $ times($ m = 2 $), the alarm will be triggered. If the user continues to snore, he will be alarmed again. The process won't stop detecting until morning once the user chooses to stop the app.\\

In this project, 8 audio samples are collected from freesound.org. Each of them contains a type of male snoring sound. Thanks to freesound.org and people who like to upload personal snoring sound, we're able to get various types of snoring which helps us to develop the app. \\

By using our analysis method, all 8 audio samples with 78 snoring episodes are detected in MatLab. Figure~\ref{fig:snoring} shows that ZCR and energy have quite clear patterns in simple snoring. In the snoring part, ZCR is relatively high and energy stays between certain limited range which characterize the snoring. In Figure~\ref{fig:snoringbreath}, snoring sound is merged with breath. As we can see, the real snoring sound have wider peak, so the classification result could be based on the continues positive count. If more than $m$ times slice of data is classified as positive snoring, it will be count as the snoring. In frequency domain as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spectrogram}, the difference between snoring and breath is mainly in low frequency part. After dividing the bands into several sub-bands, we could get 10 features vectors for each frame. The amplitudes distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:spectrogram} shows that we could use the frequency features of sound to improve classification. Using principle components analysis, two main features contributes most of the snoring characteristics. \\


In Matlab, the algorithm performs quite good since all the samples's snoring sound is detected. However, playing the samples in laptop output,  the amount of detected snoring sound is significantly less. \\

In noisy environment such as discussion area of the library, restaurants etc., snoring sound almost can not be detected while in relatively quite environment like home, snoring sound could be detected sometimes. \\

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}

An Android app used for snoring detection is built. It read raw audio data from a smart phone's microphone, and data is sliced into small segments to calculate zero crossing rate and energy. By using thresholds experimented from MatLab, the app is able to classify snoring sound and give proper alarm responses to the user. The app is tested in both noisy and quite environment in order to figure out the performance. The experiments shows that the app works good in quite environment and triggers alarms. Future work needs to be done to improve the accuracy of snoring detection.
